    <h3>written in h3 tag</h3><br>
    <h4>written in h4 tag</h4><br>
    <h5>written in h5 tag</h5><br>
    <h6>should I write "written in h6 tag here" aswell following the sequence?</h6><br>
    
    <!-- paragraphs -->

    <p>
        Just read that the paragraph tag ignores any kind of white spaces in between 
        and I suppose it's kinda true
        no matter how many breaks I put in the sentence the browser.....
        yuppp! completely ignores it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Seems like it will only go onto the next line after the line is complete?(like the display of the screen)
        or when we use another &lt;p&gt; tag
    </p>
    <p>
        But hey we can actually use the <br> &lt;br&gt; tag to break the line? pretty neat but<br>kinda tedious right?
    </p>
    <hr> <!-- hr tag is used to create a line which in context is used as a thematic break -->
     
    <!-- the almighty pre tag -->

    <pre>
        The solution to the poem problem    is   with the &lt;p&gt; of filtering out the any form fo white

        spaces or line breaks can be solved using the pre tag or in abbreviation preformatted tag         asssssssss

        it preserves both the t  e  x  t      w   i   d   th  and amount

        of 

        line 


        breaks in the source 

        code that 

        I put.
